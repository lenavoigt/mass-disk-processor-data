# Mass Disk Processor - Data Repository

In this repository, we provide data sheets created using the [Mass Disk Processor (MDP)](https://github.com/lenavoigt/mass-disk-processor). These data sheets were created in the scope of the following publication:

> Voigt, L., Freiling, F., & Hargreaves, C.J. (2025). A metrics-based look at disk images: Insights and applications. Forensic Science International: Digital Investigation, 52, 301874. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsidi.2025.301874

We collected metrics for publicly available, synthetic, scenario-based disk images. In this repository, you can find:
- [Overview_public-disks.pdf](https://github.com/lenavoigt/mass-disk-processor-data/blob/main/Overview_public-disks.pdf): An overview of the disk images considered.
- [Public_data-sheet.xlsx](TODO): A summary table of public disk metrics as considered in our paper, including a template for the creation of individual data sheets. We also provide a summary table of Plaso metrics for the disk images that were not further considered in our paper.
- [Data-sheets/](TODO): In this folder, you can find individual data sheets per disk image presenting selected metrics.
